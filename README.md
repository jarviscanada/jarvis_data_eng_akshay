# Akshay Sapra - Jarvis Consulting

I am a recent graduate from UBC where I received my mechanical engineering degree with high distinction. Over the last few years, I have self-taught myself computer science concepts throughout university, as my interest switched from mechanical engineering to computers. I have done several projects that have allowed me to expand my knowledge of the development industry. On a more personal note, my parents moved to Canada when I was 4 years old, and I believe that the hardships that come along with being an immigrant have taught me to stay determined and work hard. I have travelled the world and immersed myself with many cultures, and speak 4 different languages, and can recognize almost any variant of the English accent. My hobbies include astronomy, sports, and day trading various instruments. In totality, the data engineering industry excites me as it is an ever-changing sector with new learning opportunities around each corner.

## Development Projects


Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_akshay](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_akshay)

- **[Linux & SQL:](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_akshay/tree/master/linux_sql)** Developed The *Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent,* which is an internal tool that monitors cluster resources and saves the collected information into a database for future use. This project involved regex, SQL, RDBMS, and Bash CLI.
- **[Core Java Apps:](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_akshay/tree/master/core_java)** Developed three separate apps. Firstly, The *Java Twitter App* is a command line application that demonstrates the use of Creating, Reading and Deleting Tweets. It connects to Twitter REST API using the authentication tool OAuth 1.0. Post and Get requests were used with the twitter API, and the data was processed using the DAO design pattern. Secondly, The *GREP App* replicates some of the core features of the Linux GREP command. This app is built in Java. It uses recursion to go through all files in a given directory (even sub directories), and outputs any lines from files matching the input pattern into a temporary folder. This project involved Java I/O, lambda, streams, IntelliJ IDE and how to modularize code into functions. Thirdly, the *JDBC Project* was used to make a prototype for the fundamentals of JDBC and DAO pattern.
- **[SpringBoot App](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_akshay/tree/master/springboot)**: Developed The *Springboot Trading* *App,* which is a proof of concept of an online stock trading simulation REST API. Its a MicroService which is implemented with Springboot for internal dependency management, and Maven for external dependency management. The users of this application can get market quotes for stock tickers, details about user data, positions, and security orders, all of which are stored in the Postgres SQL database. All of the data relating to quotes comes from IEX Cloud in real time, and the app is deployed using Docker.
